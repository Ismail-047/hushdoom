### Privacy Policy for Hushdoom

**Effective Date:** February 19, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the Hushdoom Chrome extension handles your information and is intended to be clear and easy to understand for users and search engines.

## 1. Introduction

Hushdoom ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the Hushdoom Chrome extension to hide or customize social media feeds.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

Hushdoom is built on a strict privacy-first architecture. **We do not collect, transmit, store, or process any of your personal data on external servers.**

- **Analytics:** We do not use any tracking or analytics software.
- **Browsing History:** We do not monitor, record, or transmit your browsing history. The extension only inspects the URLs of supported domains locally on your device to determine if the feed should be hidden.

## 3. Data Storage

All data required for the extension to function is stored entirely within your browser using Chrome's built-in Storage API:

- **Local Storage (`chrome.storage.local`):** Your platform preferences (which sites are enabled/disabled) and active snooze timers are stored locally on your device.
- **Sync Storage (`chrome.storage.sync`):** If you add custom motivational quotes, they are stored using Chrome's sync storage. This means the quotes sync across the devices where you are logged into your Google account, but this data remains within the Google ecosystem and is never accessible to Hushdoom's developer.

## 4. Third-Party Access

Because we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, or disclose any data to third parties.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new "Effective Date." You are encouraged to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how Hushdoom protects your privacy.
